Hello. My name is Ben Welsh. I’m an Iowan living in Los Angeles.

I work as a journalist, albeit an unconventional one. I specialize in what some people call [data journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_journalism) and some others call [computer-assisted reporting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_reporting).

This README includes a directory of my open-source computer code on GitHub and other platforms. It does not include my published journalism. Visit my blog [palewi.re](https://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/) for my résumé, a database of [my news work](https://palewi.re/work/) and an archive of [my public-speaking engagements](https://palewi.re/talks/).
